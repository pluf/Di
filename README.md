# PHP Dependecy Injection

The goal of the Pluf Dependency Injection (DI) is to free a business developer from the responsibility
for obtaining objects that they need for its operation (which is called 
(separation of concerns)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns]).
Pluf DI is one of the most interesting parts of the framework. It is a compiled DI container, an important
part of the platform which is used directly in data-flow processing and workflows.
